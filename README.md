# Synthetic-Division-Calculator
Synthetic division calculator for polynomials for use on a Ti-84 graphing calculator with Python

This synthetic division calculator is used for dividing two polynomials, assuming the degree of the dividend is greater than the degree of the divisor. 
The purpose of this program is to put it into a Ti-84 Graphing Calculator with Python. 
This way, instead of manually solving synthetic division problems in math class, you can simply input the degrees of both polynomials and the coefficients of every term of each polynomial into this program to get both the quotient as a polynomial and the remainder. 

Keep in mind, the program only works assuming:
-the degree of the dividend is greater than the degree of the divisor
-the degrees of both polynomials are positive integers
-every coefficient is written as either an integer or fraction (no decimals)
